# Lab 1: Open window

## Due date: Tuesday February 7

1 point extra credit for completed assignment or accepted pull request fixing error before Thursday February 2

## Summary
The startup code for this class is cloned from (http://polytonic.github.io/Glitter/). It is intended to get you started with OpenGL by compiling and statically linking every required library, so you don't have to deal with all that. 

## Getting started

Instructions [here](https://cisc3620.github.io/docs/submissions.html)

Follow the directions to clone this repository and generate a makefile.

Compile and run. You should see a window with a gray background.

## Modify

Open main.cpp for editing. The only change you need to make for this assignment is to change the background color (the clear color) from gray to blue. The command to modify is ```glClearColor``` on line 40.

## Submit
We will use the fork and pull request workflow for submissions for this class. The idea is that you will make the required changes in your own copy, and then submit a pull request and @mention me (@rivlev). __The pull request and @mention comprise your submission for this assignment.__ For this assignment, I will only look at the changes you make to main.cpp

Stage, commit and push your changes and create a pull request to complete the submission. Instructions [here](https://cisc3620.github.io/docs/submissions.html).

This setup for this class is new, so please submit a separate pull request if you can clear up any errors or lack of clarity here.
